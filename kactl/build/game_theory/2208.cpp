 * CSES Problem: Another Game
 * Link: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2208
 * Description:
 *   addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function (e) {
 *   const mathElements = document.getElementsByClassName("math");
 *   const macros = {};
 *   for (let element of mathElements) {
 *   katex.render(element.textContent, element, {
 *   displayMode: element.classList.contains("math-display"),
 *   throwOnError: false,
 *   globalGroup: true,
 *   macros,
 *   });
 *   }
 *   });
 *   .katex .base:last-child {
 *   display: inline;
 *   }
 *   Time limit: 1.00 s
 *   Memory limit: 512 MB
 *   There are n heaps of coins and two players who move alternately. On each move, a player selects some of the nonempty heaps and removes one coin from each heap. The player who removes the last coin wins the game.
 *   Your task is to find out who wins if both players play optimally.
 *   Input
 *   The first input line contains an integer t: the number of tests. After this, t test cases are described:
 *   The first line contains an integer n: the number of heaps.
 *   The next line has n integers x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n: the number of coins in each heap.
 *   Output
 *   For each test case, print "first" if the first player wins the game and "second" if the second player wins the game.
 *   Constraints
 *   1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5
 *   1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
 *   1 \le x_i \le 10^9
 *   the sum of all n is at most 2 \cdot 10^5
 *   Example
 *   Input:
 *   3
 *   3
 *   1 2 3
 *   2
 *   2 2
 *   4
 *   5 5 4 5
 *   Output:
 *   first
 *   second
 *   first
